# World Challenges

I got my OpenAI API key and wanted to try it out.
The API is very simple and easy to use.
But, it only lets you use gpt-3.5-turbo until you spend $1.
This is not as easy as you might think; at $0.004 per 1K tokens, this is about 195,000 words, which is more words than are in Great Expectations. This is a lot of chatting over the weekend when I could be coding.

I wanted to use GPT-4, but I wanted to do something useful with all those GPU cycles...

This project is a single python file that defines personas for 25 experts that then form an AI panel to address 30 of the biggest problems facing humanity, from 25 perspectives.

![Time to create a bot army](bot_army.png)

So, let's start with GPT-4 via ChatGPT Plus to help us sketch out the personas for our panel of experts.

Me: *I want to create a panel of bots to answer important questions facing humanity. Provide system prompts to use for each of the panel members where the prompt results in that panel member using their expertise and perspective of their role or profession to elaborate on the situation described, comment on the causes, potential consequences of inaction, options for remediation, and recommended next steps. Give it to me as a python dictionary.*

ChatGPT: *That's an interesting idea! Let's create some prompts for each panel member...*

```python

# Great Expectations, The Next Generation

So, with the power of AI, we can now create a panel of experts to address the world's biggest problems.
The code is simple, it didn't take long to write, and it's easy to use. The next version of this could be using GPT-4, and include experts reviewing and voting on eachothers ideas and comments and an algorithm to surface the higher quality ideas for human review and action.

With this kind of AI, we should have great expectations.
You can see the full output of the run in the file [world_challenges_aipanel.md](world_challenges_aipanel.md).
